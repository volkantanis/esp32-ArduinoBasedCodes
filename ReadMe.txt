As per your 2nd order requirement:

Following changes has been done;

1. A new input config menu has been added - hence a new page ConfigInputPage.h has been included
2. Since you had not mentioned anything during order, so i have stored these inputs in string variables as 
   Input1, Input2, and so on.

3. To display previous settings on config menu page , the name of firstPage.h has been changed just to firstPage
   kindly note this all has been done for fast processing of data. so there is no # include "firstPage.h" as in earlier case.
   
4. In firstpage Hanler function firstPage has been called as firstPage()
   

As per  WiFi library, you can choose to not to keep AP_password or if you keep then keep it of min 8 length. 
   
I have attached the images of your requirement that has been accomplished.

Since this task has been successfully completed as per your 2nd order requirement, I am delivering your order,
kindly review it, and in case of any query just let me know.
I would be able to answer your queries after 9 pm.
